# Big Data Project

This project is a collaboration between Chahan Movsessian, Paul Zanaglia, Nicolas Guiblin, and Quentin Scordo. It consists of two main sub-projects: a Voldemort project and a MongoDB project. Each project includes a server and a client. The server provides a database service, and the client interacts with this service.

## Video Presentation

## Directory Structure

- `Voldemort/`: This directory contains the Voldemort project. Refer to the [Voldemort README](./Voldemort-Engine/README.md) for instructions on how to build and run the Voldemort server and client.
- `MongoDB/`: This directory contains the MongoDB project. Refer to the [MongoDB README](./MongoDB-Engine/README.md) for instructions on how to build and run the MongoDB server and client.

## How to Run the Projects

1. Choose the project you want to run (Voldemort or MongoDB).
2. Start the server for the chosen project. Instructions can be found in the corresponding README.
3. Once the server is running, you can compile and run the client. Instructions can be found in the corresponding README.
