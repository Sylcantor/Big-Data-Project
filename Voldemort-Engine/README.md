# Voldemort-Engine

This project consists of a Voldemort server and a client that connects to the server. The server provides a database service, and the client interacts with this service.

## Directory Structure

- `server/`: This directory contains the Voldemort server project. Refer to the [server README](./server/voldemort-release-1.10.25-cutoff/README.md) for instructions on how to run the server.
- `client/`: This directory contains the client project. Refer to the [client README](./client/README.md) for instructions on how to compile and run the client.

## How to Run the Project

1. Start the Voldemort server. Instructions can be found in the [server README](./server/voldemort-release-1.10.25-cutoff/README.md).

2. Once the server is running, you can compile and run the client. Instructions can be found in the [client README](./client/README.md).
